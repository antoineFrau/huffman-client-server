# HUFFMAN TCP/IP

> Using Huffman to compress file on the server and send it to the client.
> He will need to decrypt the file so we send also a dictionary with code realeted to lettre. <br>
> The server can only compress file sized under 400 octets
> cause of the generated huffman tree and associated binary code > at 8 bits

 

## Explain how does it work

Execute Main.java file, it will start the server Socket, and connect a client to it.

Then you will be ask to enter a number, corresponding to the index of the file list send by the server.

If nothing show and you need to enter the number just press 0, it will work anyway. Have Fun !

(If you want a knew file just restart the program)

## TODO

    - Send file sized > at 400 octets
    - Graphical interface
    - Run mutiple clients on the server
    - Send a demand for antother file
