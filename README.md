# HUFFMAN TCP/IP

> Using Huffman to compress file on the server and send it to the client.
> He will need to decrypt the file so we send also a dictionary with code realeted to lettre. <br>
> The server can only compress file sized under 400 octets
> cause of the generated huffman tree and associated binary code > at 8 bits

 

## Explain how does it work

Start the Main file, and enter the number 0 then see the magic ! 

## TODO

    - Graphical interface
    - Run mutiple clients on the server
